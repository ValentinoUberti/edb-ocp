Ditch the database drama and embrace the power of EDB - the cloud-native database that installs in minutes.

- Serverless, autoscaling database built for the cloud
- 99.99% availability with automated failover
- Seamless integration with OpenShift
- Easy to set up and manage
- Level 5 OLM Operator


EDB is perfect for developers and engineering teams who want to unlock the full potential of the cloud and of the on-premise OpenShift clusters as you will stop wasting cycles on complex setups and enjoy a hassle-free database experience that scales with your needs.

Also, EDB gives you a fully-managed, cloud-native database that just works. With the simplicity of ACM, you can have it up and running in no time on selected OpenShift clusters thanks to the ACM governance policies using the GitOps approach.

Thanks to the well know ACM policies is easy to apply any resources to a selected set of OpenShift clusters using labels. Multiple ACM policies applied in a specific order are required to install and configure an operator like the EDB one. The ACM policies dependencies feature is fully supported from ACM 2.7.
